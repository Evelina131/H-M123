            <h2>Sustainability</h2>
            <p>For almost 30 years, we’ve been working with sustainability. It’s part of our business idea – to offer our customers the best combination of fashion, quality, price and sustainability – and we believe that sustainable fashion should not be limited to the few.We’ve made a lot of progress, however there is still much more to do. Across our industry, we need to reduce our impact on the climate, improve our social impact and build a better fashion system. And we need to do this transparently.In this section of our website, you will find information on our goals and how we are going to reach them, as well as the standards and policies that guide our work.</p>
